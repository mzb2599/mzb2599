## 👋 About Me  

I’m a MERN Stack Developer with 3+ years of professional experience, specializing in React.js, frontend architecture, and scalable web applications. I’ve worked in Microsoft and Apple enterprise environments via Infosys, contributing to production-grade applications used at scale.

My experience spans frontend-heavy React applications, backend APIs using Node.js, cloud migration on Microsoft Azure, and data visualization dashboards. Recently, I’ve been actively building LLM-powered applications, including document-based insight dashboards and chatbots.

I’m currently open to MERN / Full Stack / Frontend-focused roles where I can solve complex problems, write clean and maintainable code, and deliver real business impact.
